      <title>The beauty of DevOps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my latest client, I got hired as a Fullstack JavaScript developer, plus DevOps, plus Frontend. The project is to rebuild the old PHP codebase onto a new stack containing Node, Angular, Microservices and all with Docker and continuous deployment and testing. As complicated as it sounds, new projects don&amp;rsquo;t have the nitty gritty problems legacy systems have. I think, what you have to bring to such a project is a broad and sort of deep understanding of each technology and how they can interact together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous position was as a Senior Frontend Developer, working with Angular 1 and 2. There, you have to have a deep understanding of the framework, and where to get the latest percentages of performance out. And, how to refactor constantly an ever growing codebase. So sometimes, people I am telling that, they think you have to have a really deep understanding in every technology I touch. But sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just not needed and possible. You can set up a MongoDB for a certain microservice, and knowing this form of database works fine. Later on, you can hire or look deeper in how to scale and improve performance with this certain technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives you a lot of freedom, but also responsibility. What I touch at the moment the most, is the so called &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;. When you are last project was implementing NodeJS patterns and structure, you sort of feel the beauty of the pure analytical work of setting up, and monitoring services. There is no big guessing or &amp;ldquo;lets see&amp;rdquo; factor. At least not at the level as pure programming has. Finally, you have to have a clear picture of which service should talk to which, how they should give feedback and how and with which tools you meassure performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, all the little details can be nasty and hard, but for the first few days after this shift in perspectives, you have the feeling of power and overview of the system. In return, it helps to understand when a service should respond with critical feedback, and how this feedback should look like. Sometimes, I think, starting from this perspective can help deciding which service should contain which logic, and how big a certain micros service should get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a front end developer, I appreciate to start the project with a clear UX/UI guideline and idea. From a backend developer perspective, I know appreciate an approach first designed by the devops perspective. It helps how the system should respond in which occasion, and after that, you know how to structure and design your code base.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Usedum in fall</title>
      <link>http://gruberbastian.com/post/usedum/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2016 14:37:04 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://gruberbastian.com/post/usedum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-bridge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bridge into the baltic&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hectic and grey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berlin is vibrant, always “on” and full of inspirational people. If you are looking for something, you will find it. But, what makes the city such a astounding place to live in, is also the reason why it is draining your energy and emotions.
Not alone this, but the architecture of big and wide streets and sometimes narrow and huge houses are great in the summer, but aweful to look at in Winter. The sun comes out from noon to around 4 PM, and doesn’t leave much warmth and energy to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I started the habit to leave the city around this time of the year, escaping the bitterness and getting some rest and energy in other places in Europe. This time, I stayed in Germany and went with my partner to Usedom, which is an area at the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/karlshagen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Karlshagen&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Germany such a livable country is it’s ability to travel for around 2 hours maximum out of every big city and be in the middle of an rural area. The train system definitely deserves it’s international fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting how you can immediately feel the difference in the culture of the people the further you go out of booming areas like Munich, Berlin or Hamburg. Each part of the country has it’s own culture, but shares the same core values or behaviours. People tend to be more shy, conscious about privacy and careful about visitors and people not from this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to ask yourself why. With a country this small, one can think that it’s easy to have one more or less common behaviour. It’s astounding how it differs, even from small city to small city. Part of the reason could be that germans don’t like to travel longer distances during the week or weekends. Even a 3-4 hours train ride is something just for the holidays or special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-train.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Train to Karlshagen&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, having a partner from Canada lets you rethink about this behaviour, and easily book a 44 Euro so called “Ostsee-Ticket” to go up north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;quote&gt;“Growing up in a small village with 200 people made me understand this behaviour, living in bigger cities ever since let me go past and exploit it.”&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at our last train stops in Zinnowitz, you could feel how uncomfortable people are when somebody is walking around with a DSLR and taking pictures. Growing up in a small village with 200 people made me understand this behaviour, living in bigger cities ever since let me go past and exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-trainstation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kralshagen train station&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-trainrails.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Karlshagen train rails&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we arrived safely and already well adjusted to the environment. The air smelled fresher, and the pace of a small town has an immediate impact also on your mental health. We walked the 900m from the train station in Karlshagen to the house we rented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving in Karlshagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way there, we passed by big buildings with multiple apartments in it. It was clear from the beginning that this is a tourist region. No big factories, just paying customers mostly over the summer to see the nature and the beauty of northern Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-houses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Apartments in Karlshagen&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-holidayhouses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Holiday homes&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political background of the region, and especially Karlshagen, is as every smaller town in Germany strongly coined by the second world war. The whole area was a Nazi research camp, with factories for rockets and KZ where jews were hold and killed. The current political mindset is mostly left, with over 40% voting for “Die Linke”, and another 40% for their own funded political party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, there were 100% white germans in this town. No foreigner would move to this part of Germany with almost nothing to offer other than nature. My guess is, you have to have roots in this community to live there and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prices for those homes are not skyrocketing. Fall and Winter are not the high seasons, so you can get one night for a 4 bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms, a huge kitchen and living room plus sauna for around 120 Euro a night. This house could easily fit 3-4 couples or two families. During summer, when everything is green and you could actually go into the baltic sea, the prices go up to around 350 Euro per night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-kitchen.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Holiday home kitchen&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-livingroom.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Holiday home livingroom&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the keys, you call the company you book the house, and a person will arrive shortly after to hand you over the keys with some information about the town and close by sights. After unpacking and settling in, we went and explored the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked by the first few restaurants, where the opening times reflected the amount of people visiting at those cold autumn days. For breakfast, you have to be there from 9 to 11 AM, and for coffee and cake around 2 to 4 PM. Our plan was also to rent some bikes, instead of bringing our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, modernity arrived in Karlshagen. There are several bike spots with locked bikes. You can call a number to register at “Usedum Bike Rental” and pay 9 Euro for 24h of having a bike. You will get the code for the lock by phone and can bring it back to any station you want. Really convenient and not expensive. The bikes itself are solid. No mountain or race bikes, but good enough to bike the whole day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 10 minutes of walking, we arrived at the coast and could feel the wind of the sea and smell the fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-beach.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Karlshagen beach&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were around 10 people around the beach, and in far distance from each other. We came for a quiet and calm down week and this is what we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A normal day in Karlshagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring the environment and getting a good amount of nature, we got back inside to start our routine of sauna, cooking and watching an episode of Black Mirror or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-sauna.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Holiday home sauna&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-dinner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dinner&#34;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/usedum-writing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Couch and MacBook&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The houses next to ours were all empty until the very last night, so no kids noises or loud discussions. Closes the door was the effort to make for having a quiet and relaxing afternoon and evening. The advantage of the place was that it has two floors. The bedroom was upstairs, so sleeping and living was separated. Perfect for leaving the living room not super tidy and still be able to switch your mind into sleep mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cooking and preparing meals, the kitchen had everything to offer and more. There were around 20 sets of dishes for all possible occasions. We wouldn’t even need the dishwashers, but did so after each meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next shopping opportunity for groceries was “Paul”, the nearby Edeka. It was around 2 bike minutes or 10 by foot away. It had everything to offer and also included a bakery with fresh baked goods for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About</title>
      <link>http://gruberbastian.com/post/about/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2016 16:37:27 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://gruberbastian.com/post/about/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/gruberb-blog/me.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;picture of Bastian Gruber&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s me, Bastian, a passionate software developer. I am using Go, JavaScript and HTML/CSS to create web applications, and always keen and happy to help a software project to thrive. Next to coding I am a tech writer, mostly for Apple magazines. I also contribute to various german tech magazines. Those two professions let me earn enough money to appreciate and learn other hobbies like photography and improvisation theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to define languages and skills, since I am constantly challenged with new architectures, ideas and platforms. But, I am very comfortable using following tools to help your project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (NodeJS, AngularJS 1 + 2, ReactJS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment via Docker on AWS (and others like Heroku)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continous deployment and delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing with Jasmine, Mocha, Sinon and ShouldJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also implement code patterns and &amp;ldquo;behaviours&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing first, then implementing the functionality (TDD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Oriented Programming (OOP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional Programming (FP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of all three paradigms. The overall architecture is most of the time object oriented, with small functions with no side effects. It&amp;rsquo;s great to implement the tests first, so I have a guidance while implementing the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to look at my projects at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gruberb&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and follow me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bastiangruber&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to have a detailed CV with projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, have a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;https://de.linkedin.com/in/bastiangruber&#34;&gt;LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;bubble&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#34;I have had the great pleasure to work with Bastian at smartB long enough to say a couple of things about him. Bastian is curious and self-motivated. He&#39;ll find a way to do things better and improve quality. The challenge from a management perspective is keeping him continuously motivated. As an exceptional developer requires an exceptional management to make sure he is able to deliver software while being challenged to do so. Bastian is a problem solver and someone I would definitely pursue for any company I work for.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;name&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;bubble&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#34;I had the chance to work with Bastian in Glispa in different projects. Whether it&#39;s HTML/CSS or Javascript, he&#39;s equally capable to both craft a state-of-the-art web project or to rework an existing one. He has a good critical sense, and he&#39;s capable of finding what&#39;s wrong on interfaces pointing his attention on both UX and UI. It was a pleasure to work with Bastian and I definitely recommend him if you have to make something nice and quickly.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;bubble&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#34;I had the pleasure of working with Bastian at glispa, collaborating on several projects, including Voltu. I was totally impressed by his ability to juggle multiple projects, it was unlike any I’ve seen before and made a dramatic difference in the productivity and professional level of our team.

  As a person, Bastian has a bright entrepreneurial mindset. He shares his knowledge and constantly improves skills to build meaningful things.

  Bastian would be a true asset to any team, because he is a talented, hard-working and warm co-worker! &#34;&lt;/p&gt;

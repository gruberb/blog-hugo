The best advice is always a double edge sword. It's so simple so everybody understands, but to fully understand a simple advice you have to have felt the pain and struggle not following it in the first place.

Every developer knows RTFM by heart. It gets thrown around a bunch of times a week and everybody knows he/she should do it but most probably raley will. Me personally, I started in the mainframe world with PL/I as the main language. There are no StackOverflow questions or answers. Your only source of information is the oldest colleagues and the IBM manual from 1960.

Leaving this space and entering the (Berlin) StartUp world was a huge relieve. But with the dying pain of a 120x80 terminal, so died good practices about how to read and understand code. Instead of studying the JavaScript engine, I threw together frameworks and deployed apps production ready within a week.

But, RTFM never leaves you.

After coming back from an almost 7 months break of Europe and the working world, I joined a project to enable machines communicate together. Buzzwords are IoT and Industry 4.0. It was hard at first, to get back into the coding mindset and reading and understanding code again. Thanks to very experienced team members I hade one huge revelation: RTFM still stands true.

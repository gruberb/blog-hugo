The dilemma of our privilidged and comfortable lifes as software engineers is:
- There are always so many new things to get into and play around with
- After playing around with them enough, there are thousnads possibilities to earn money with your new skills, or:
- Join other people with the same interest and just have fun

But also, it's insanely hard after a long day of work to get enough headspace. If you have kids, it's even "harder". Though many will claim having a child and seeing it grow up in front of you is way more fun then the latest technology.

As everything in life, it's a balance.

Therefore, my aim is to shut off every distraction which is not needed and focus every month just on one thing. I will pick a technology and just focus on this one. Which means: Unsubscribe from every newsletter, don't read twitter and don't participate in other MeetUps or discussions. Pure focus.

Obviously you have to manage your income stream to help feeding yourself and your family. Therefore work is allowed ;)

So, the following month (September) I will focus solely on Rust. In this regards, I opened up a MeetUp format called ["Rust and Tell"](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Berlin/events/254194727/) in Berlin, which helps to remember enjoying this new language and hear people struggling and building projects with it.

The process so far:
- I started the MeetUp format
- I already worked throug around 1/3 of the Rust book
- I try to participate as much as I can in the [Net Web working group](https://github.com/rust-net-web)


I also want to use this blog more, so I will irregularly blog about the process.

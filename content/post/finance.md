I am now a few years into this whole "working and earing" lifecycle. In the beginning, especially as a student, I spend most of my freelance and other work money on the latest Apple Hardware, books and clubs. Now, being older, wiser and more careful, I decided to take finance and money a bit more serious.

In this post, I offer you financial wisdom. I think you don't need a finance guru to survive. At least not when you are not rich and just want to build up a solid financial foundation. You basically need to invest 150 Euro in tools and books, and afterwards a lot of discipline to follow through.

## <a name="mind"></a>A new mindset

I read somewhere the following quote:
"To save 10% of your income, you have to be hard on yourself, to save 50% you have to switch your mindset."

And once you changed your mindset, you don't have to be hard on yourself anymore. And here it comes, the first steps.

This is the online financial tool you actually need. These people are doing a tremendous job in offering you a new way of budgeting. It's a new lifestyle and will change your life, nothing less.

#### What is it?

YNAB is a tool which helps you budget. What sounds weird and not very sexy, you should stop using your other tools. They are basically worthless. YNAB has 4 rules

- Give every Dollar a job
- Roll with the punches
- Save for rainy days
- Age your money

Means: Your income will be distributed to your choosen categories until you have 0 left. Categories are like groceries, dining out, movies etc. Roll with the punches means: When unplanned events accour, move money from one category to the overspent one. With this, you are always in the "know" and are aware how your money actually flows. "Save for the rainy days" means, you should have a budget called "car repair", "taxes" and more along the line. So bills which are due once a year or less frequent. You gonna divide the yearly amount in monthly chunks and budget them every month. When the bills come, you already have the right amount in your category.

And of course, "Age your money". You should spend at least last months income or more. Don't live paycheck to paycheck. With an age indicator, YNAB tells you how old the money is you are currently spending. So the older the money, the safer and freer you are.

Timeframe: For me, almost 9 years. I went on and off with YNAB. But for solid 2 years now I am fully in, save more than 50% of my income and use the software every day.

This book


Timeframe: Around 2 years of constantly reading and trying to apply my own, better and healthier mindset. It will probably never end, so have fun in seeing little improvements over time and gain more confidence to live your own life along the way.

## <a name="money"></a>Your money or your life
----


Timeframe: 2 months and I fully understood what the author wants to tell me. Occasionly re-reading it.

## <a name="stocks"></a>Stocks (RoboAdviser and your own portfolio)
----

Uh, the stock market. Scary, just for people with gel hair and bankers. I think once you followed step 1-3, you must feel very aware of your money by now and have fun see it grow. The stock market is nothing else. It can be on steroids, but it will be probaly more moderat (around 6-10% a year).

You can buy shares from lets say Apple, for around 140 Euro per share at the moment. Now, when the value of Apple grows (more sold iPhones etc.), your share is also growing. So if you invest 1000 Euro in Apple stocks, and Apple as a company is highering their value to 5%, your investment also grows 5%.

You won't get richt, but with a combination of ETFs, Stocks and the use of RoboAdviser, you can most probably gain a solid 10% return every year from your hard saved money.

Timeframe: It took me around 4 months of daily reading and investigating to feel solid enough to invest small amounts on my own and start to build a solid knowledge of the stock market.
